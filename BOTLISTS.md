![Why use Suggester?](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/701814693785764020/770699355996028928/sbanneruseDONE2.png)

Suggester is the most configurable suggestion bot on Discord, with many settings that can be tailored to your server such as:
- Setting roles that can manage suggestions
- Allowing only certain roles to submit suggestions
- Cleaning suggestion commands
- Blocking roles from submitting suggestions
- Customizing voting emojis
- Allowing only certain roles to vote on suggestions
- Server language

Additionally, we have a unique **review** mode that allows staff members to review suggestions before they are sent to the suggestions channel! This is the mode used by default, but we also offer the **autoapprove** mode which automatically sends suggestions to the approved channel.

Suggester also allows you to keep your server members updated via commenting and marking statuses!

> Suggester completely changed my way of keeping in touch with server members. Managing user suggestions and keeping them updated about what they truly care about has never been so streamlined! Comments and votes are the easiest way to turn the spotlight on for most wanted and high quality suggestions. Would 100% recommend.
